<h2 align="center">Hi, I'm Franklin</h2>

<p align="center">I'm a recent Network and IT Security undergraduate with experience in sys admin, cryptography, statistics and data science, and also web design. I'm also into data analytics and love exploring ways it could be used to solve problems. Currently working on an ETL project while gradually adding more tools and steps to practice my BI and data engineering skills. </p>
